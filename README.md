Assorted TeX-ed notes for ECON, MATH and COMP classes at McGill University

## ECON 468 Final Review

I will be giving a Final Review Session for ECON 468 (Econometrics I - Honours) on **December 1st, 6PMâ€“8PM** at an as of yet unknown location. 

The notes for this session are named "econ468-final-review-[date]" where [date] is when I last updated the notes. I will be keeping an errata log here, just in case I make any grevious error (I really, really hope not). To **download the file**, click on the file name and click download at the top right. 

If there are any errata, or if you have any questions, **please email me at tiffany.yong@mail.mcgill.ca**. Feel free to star my repo if you have a github account :P. 


### About the notes

You will notice that the notes are 30 pages long. This is meant to be an **exhaustive** resource for your final exam preparation. I have detailed out basically every proof you need, and section numbers and table of contents are clickable once you've downloaded the pdf so you can jump between them. If you read and understand all of this, I'm fairly certain you're going to do well on the exam. 

### About the review session


For the actual review session, I will only be discussing **post-midterm content**, so **Section 3 onwards**. Sections 1 & 2 is just to familiarise yourself with all the pre-midterm stuff you need to understand the post-midterm content. If you are coming to the final review, please briefly scan through sections 1 & 2 **before coming**, and if you don't understand it, take the time to ensure you do. Otherwise I'm not sure if things will make much sense to you. 

If you're happy with the notes and understand everything, you may or may not want to come to the review session. I will be trying my best to give intuition and interesting examples for the material.
